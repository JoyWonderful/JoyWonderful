    <!-- This verse announces the birth of the beast (Netscape) and warns bad coders (up to Netscape 3, when you watched the HTML source code with the internal viewer, bad tags blinked). -->

    <p class="moztext">
        And the beast shall come forth surrounded by a roiling <em>cloud</em> of
        <em>vengeance</em>. The house of the unbelievers shall be <em>razed</em>
        and they shall be <em>scorched</em> to the earth. Their tags shall <em>blink</em>
        until the end of <em>days.</em>
        <br>
        伴随滚滚<em>复仇</em>之<em>云</em>，野兽将一往无前。不信者的房子将被<em>夷为平地</em>，他们自己将被<em>烧为焦土</em>，他们的标签将会闪烁直到世界<em>末日</em>。

        And the beast shall be made <em>legion</em>.
        Its numbers shall be increased a <em>thousand thousand</em> fold.
        The din of a million keyboards like unto a great <em>storm</em>
        shall cover the earth, and the followers of Mammon shall <em>tremble</em>.
        <br>
        野兽将会<em>无所不在</em>。他的数目将会暴增到<em>上千千倍</em>之多。无数嘈杂的键盘将会像<em>风暴</em>一样袭卷地球，玛门的追随者将受到<em>撼动</em>。

    <p class="moztext">
        And so at last the beast <em class="f">fell</em> and the unbelievers rejoiced.
        But all was not lost, for from the ash rose a <em>great bird</em>.
        The bird gazed down upon the unbelievers and cast <em class="f">fire</em>
        and <em>thunder</em> upon them. For the beast had been
        <em>reborn</em> with its strength <em>renewed</em>, and the
        followers of <em>Mammon</em> cowered in horror.
        <br>
        最后野兽终于<em>没落</em>，不信者欢欣鼓舞。不过一切并没有失去，因为灰烬中冒出了一只<em>巨大的鸟禽</em>。那只鸟禽望向不信者，并将<em>火</em>与<em>雷</em>加诸于他们身上。野兽已经<em>重生</em>，力量更甚<em>强大</em>，<em>玛门</em>的追随者仓皇逃逸。

        Mammon slept. And the <em>beast reborn</em> spread over the earth and its numbers
        grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and <em>sacrificed</em> crops unto the
        fire, with the <em>cunning of foxes</em>. And they built a new world in their own
        image as promised by the <em><a href="/about/manifesto.html">sacred words</a></em>,
        and <em><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/About:mozilla">spoke</a></em> of the beast with their children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was
        <em>naught</em> but a follower.
        <br>
        玛门沉睡了。<em>野兽重生</em>遍布地面，而且无所不在。它们称颂时代并<em>献出</em>作物直至灵巧的狐狸带来火焰。它们并依照自己的形象创造新天地，正如<em><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">神圣之言</a></em>所应许，尚有野兽以及孩子的<em><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/About:mozilla">话语</a></em>所预言的，玛门苏醒，看！他只是个<em>无价值</em>的追随者。

        The <em>twins</em> of Mammon quarrelled. Their warring plunged the world into a

        The Beast adopted <em>new raiment</em> and studied the ways of <em>Time</em> and

        From its studies, the Beast fashioned new structures from <em>oxidised metal</em> and proclaimed
        their glories. And the Beast’s followers rejoiced, finding renewed purpose in these <em>teachings</em>.
        <br>
        野兽披上<em>新装</em>，查究贯通宇宙的<em>时</em>、<em>空</em>、<em>光</em>与能量<em>流动</em>之道。在那之后，野兽从<em>氧化金属</em>长出新躯干，宣告了他们的辉煌。野兽的追随者欢欣鼓舞，自这些<em>教训</em>中重获新的方向。
